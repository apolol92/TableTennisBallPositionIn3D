# TableTennisBallPositionIn3D
Not professional.. just some testing.
Put the table tennis ball on your google cardboard and couple it with your virtual reality game :) 
Contains server which send data to a client.. just receive data with your game.
Or use the normal script for testing without server.
I am using no calibration because my printer wasn't avaible.
Concept works, but I don't like programming real games. So I just program a private game with Unity3D and I cant publish it because I wasn't sure of the copyright.
You just have to start the BallTrackingServer and connect your own game to the server.
Finally calibrate the incoming data for your porpose.
